title: Dilute Solute Diffusion
authors: H. Wu, T. Mayeshiba, D. Morgan

description:
A total of more than 360 dilute solute diffusion systems in FCC,
BCC, and HCP host lattices (Al, Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt, Mg, Fe, W, Mo,
Au, Ca, Ir, Pb, and Ag) have been determined using density
functional theory (DFT) calculations and multi-frequency
diffusion models. This dataset includes the jump barriers and
attempt frequencies for each solute as well as final Arrhenius
diffusion constant (D₀) and diffusion activation barrier (Q).

Fe-X:
Diffusion values for Fe-X are given for the α-BCC phase, both
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. The paramagnetic D₀ and Q are
given here, the full diffusivity can be obtained by:
D_BCC(T) = D0_para * exp[-Q_para*(1+αs²)/(kT)]
where α=0.156 and s is the temperature dependent spontaneous
magnetization of Fe relative to T=0K.
