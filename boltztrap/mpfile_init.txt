remarks:
S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ the conductivity, and κₑ the
electronic part of the thermal conductivity. The values reported
are the maximum (minimum for κₑ) of the average of the
eigenvalues of the respective tensors. The values of the doping
and the temperature that give that maximum are also reported.
mₑᶜᵒⁿᵈ is the conductivity effective mass. The values reported
are the eigenvalues and their average at a doping level of 10¹⁸
cm⁻³ and at a temperature of 300 K. All the properties are
reported for both doping type (n and p). The properties that
depend on the relaxation time are reported divided by the
constant value τ used.
