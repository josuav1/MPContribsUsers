Files for the import of XMCD and XAS data from the ALS Beamline 6.3.1 into the materials project.
Please contact Alpha N'Diaye for specifics. (atndiaye@lbl.gov)


Status: 

Reads an single XMCD scan and does processing with it. It plots the XAS and XMCD and generates an output data structure which still has to be exported into an actual MPFile.

Processing is governed by and MPFile which contains a referene to the file and a list of processing steps. 

The script perfomes the processing steps and appends potential return values from each step to the MPFile datastructure.



Usage:

python ALS_import.py mp_input/atn_test_input.txt 




To do:

Define how to use a process multiple times

Define how to submit the same composition with multiple variants (e.g. preparation conditions) and how to submit the same composition from multiple contributors.

Export to MPFile

Handle multiple files

Access to general parameters section in MPFile (if necesary)

Prettier plot (How can I plot XAS and XMCD vs. Energy within Pandas?)
