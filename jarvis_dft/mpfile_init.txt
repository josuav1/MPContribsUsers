description:
Comparison of exfoliation energies Eₓ between Jarvis-DFT and NUS-2D.
(JARVIS-DFT) The website contains over ~16000 density functional
theory calculation (315634 sub-calculations) data for pure
elements, 2D, solar cell and thermoelectric materials. For 2D
materials, bulk and 1 layer material properties are compared
right now with three different exchange-correlation
functional-LDA, PBE and PBEBO (else only PBEBO is used). The
PBEBO (or optB88vDW) generally works well for 2D materials.
(NUS-2D) 2,000 layered materials by applying simple rules
based on inter-atomic plane spacing and bonded clusters of atoms
in the structures, similar to what Hennig’s group has done. He
then calculated exfoliation energy of these materials to identify
possible layered structures that can be experimentally exfoliated
into 2D materials. He has almost completed high-throughput
calculations on the properties of these 2D materials.
