description:
Redox Materials Thermochemistry Data for Application in
Concentrated Solar Power. We have measured thermodynamic data of
perovskites ABOₓ with x=3-δ, i.e. ΔH and ΔS in dependence of the
non-stoichiometry δ by means of thermogravimetric analysis. That
means, we measured the mass changes in dependence of T and p(O₂),
determined the corresponding non-stoichiometry changes and used
this data to extract thermodynamic properties from van’t Hoff
plots. [t=1.006]
