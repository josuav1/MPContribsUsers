title: Defect Genome PCFC

description:
Defect Genome of Cubic Perovskites for Fuel Cell Applications.
Employing computationally tractable ab initio models driven by
highly scalable workflows, to study formation and interaction of
various point defects (e.g., O vacancies, H interstitials, and Y
substitutional dopant), in over 80 cubic perovskites, for
potential proton-conducting ceramic fuel cell (PCFC)
applications.
