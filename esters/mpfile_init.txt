description:
More accurate c-axis lattice parameter than what is currently on MP. The
downside is that this calculation increases the error of the a-axis lattice
parameter from 1.9% to 2.5%. The error in the c-axis lattice parameter,
however, is decreased from 4.9% to 2.8%, and the error in the cell volume
decreases from 8.9% to 7.9%.
