title: Fe-Co-V Magnetic Thin Films

description:
The in-plane energy product, the maximum stored magnetic energy, is
shown for a combinatorial library of sputter deposited Fe-Co-V thin
films. In addition, a comparison of MOKE screening to more traditional
VSM measurements is detailed by coercive field (μ₀-HC) data. The
composition of each thin film is also displayed with the accompanying
entries.
